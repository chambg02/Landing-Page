# Landing-Page
Practice at making landing page - Odin Assignment

What I learnt:
  - Flexbox containers and items... important to understand the layering and where to apply the commands.
  - flex containers within flex containers with flex items inside. If you need to control positions within an item, make it a container. 
  - Align vs Justify for rows vs columns. 
  - Use of margins vs padding.
  - Use CSS-Exercises examples for isolated solutions. Google makes it harder to find stuff.
